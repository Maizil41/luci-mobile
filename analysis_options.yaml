# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  
  # GRADUAL ADOPTION STRATEGY:
  # Rules are organized by priority for incremental enabling.
  # Start with critical rules (resource management, security) and gradually
  # uncomment stricter rules as violations are fixed.
  
  rules:
    # === PHASE 1: CRITICAL RULES (ENABLED) ===
    # Resource management rules - Keep these enabled for memory safety
    close_sinks: true
    cancel_subscriptions: true
    
    # Security rules - Keep these enabled for security
    avoid_print: true
    
    # === PHASE 2: ERROR HANDLING (ENABLED) ===
    # Error handling rules - Important for app stability
    unawaited_futures: true
    avoid_catching_errors: true
    
    # === PHASE 3: CODE QUALITY (COMMENTED OUT - ENABLE GRADUALLY) ===
    # Uncomment these rules one by one after fixing existing violations
    # prefer_final_locals: true
    # prefer_const_constructors: true
    # always_specify_types: true
    
    # === PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE (COMMENTED OUT - ENABLE GRADUALLY) ===
    # Uncomment these rules after phase 3 is complete
    # avoid_function_literals_in_foreach_calls: true
    # prefer_collection_literals: true
    
    # === PHASE 5: STYLE (COMMENTED OUT - ENABLE LAST) ===
    # These are cosmetic and should be enabled last
    # directives_ordering: true
    # prefer_single_quotes: true
    
    # === PHASE 6: ADDITIONAL STRICT RULES (COMMENTED OUT) ===
    # These are the strictest rules - enable only when ready
    # sort_pub_dependencies: true
    # public_member_api_docs: true
