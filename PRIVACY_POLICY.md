LuCI Mobile ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application ("App") collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use the App to manage your OpenWrt/LuCI routers.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. User Credentials
- The App requires your router's IP address, username, and password to connect to your device.
- These credentials are stored securely on your device using industry-standard encryption (via `flutter_secure_storage`).
- We do **not** collect, transmit, or store your credentials on any external servers.

### b. Network Data
- The App communicates directly with your router to display network status, connected clients, and system information.
- All data is retrieved in real-time from your router and is **not** sent to any third-party servers.

### c. Usage Data
- We do **not** collect analytics, usage statistics, or any personal data from your device.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- To authenticate and connect to your router.
- To display network and system information from your router within the App.
- To securely store your credentials locally for your convenience.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- We do **not** share, sell, or disclose your information to any third parties.
- All communication is strictly between your device and your router.

## 4. Security

- Credentials are stored using secure storage mechanisms provided by your device.
- The App supports HTTPS connections and can handle self-signed certificates for secure communication with your router.
- We recommend using strong passwords and enabling HTTPS on your router for additional security.

## 5. Children's Privacy

- The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
- We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
